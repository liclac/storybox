Editing
=======

Storybox uses a format called [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with some extensions (like normal newlines).

---

Text Formatting
---------------

Make something *italicized* by surrounding it with `*asterisks*`.
Make something **bold** by surrounding it with `**two asterisks**`.
Make something ~~struck through~~ by surrounding it with `~~two tildes~~`.

Headings
--------
Make headings by simply underlining them with dashes:

`This is a heading`
`-----------------`

Dividers
--------
Insert a horizontal line...

---

...with three or more dashes (like `---`).
Remember to put a blank line before, otherwise it turns into a heading!
